# home-assistant-kvvlive
Home-Assistant component for real-time departure information of KVV public transport in the region of Karlsruhe (Germany).

This component relies on the [kvvliveapi python bindings](https://github.com/Nervengift/kvvliveapi) to query the (unofficial) API used by the KVV Live App. Since this API is to my knowledge neither official nor well documented it is subject to change without notice which consequently break this component.
